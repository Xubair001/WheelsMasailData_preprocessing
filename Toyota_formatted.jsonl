We've owned the Vitz since 2015 and it is the daily driver of the house as my mother uses it to go to her job near Kasur everyday and is also used to get groceries, etc. The car has 185K on the odo, which haven't been tampered with. Bought the Corolla last year in October and got quite a few things done like the spark plugs (got the saday copper ones because of my mechanic asking me to get them before I go for iridium as saday suit the car better), valve cover gasket, axle boots, transmission fluid and air and oil filters changed. The car shows 133k on the clock but me and my driver, who's been with us for quite a while and generally knows about a lot of the tricks from the used car world as he also has contacts throughout Lahore, think that it's probably around 180k-200k. Vitz: The car has had it's CVT fluid changed at 80K intervals, has had a few throttle services and it's fan motor changed. The alternator gave out on me in May, 2022 but I was forced to get it repaired by " Jaan'nay wala who repairs Jerman ki gariyan" and he repaired it with the wrong alternator assy. (I think the car comes with the long one but they used the shorter one) and now I wears through belts every 6 months. It has been run on 20W-50 Petron (Changed at every 4000Km) and I've been meaning to switch it back to 5W-30 (I haven't figured out the brand but the best one that's not a gimmick.) or at the very least 5W-50 Taglon. Furthermore, I think the cars engine mounts are also giving out and they should be replaced. My driver agrees with me going for preventative maintenance but also wants to get the most out of the genuine part, because they are the best. He disagrees with me on switching back to a thinner oil grade as it would blow the short block up. The car has lifter tick it could be a side- effect of the thicker oil. I hate it with all my might. What can I do to get rid of it? The car runs fine on 20W-50 and I'm the only mechanically inclined one in my family, so I am a little afraid of switching to a thinner oil grade after the milage kiyoun kay head assembly dalwany ki gunjaish nahi hai aur amma ki gaari pay pangay laynay ka nuqsan malnorishment hou jaata hai. I also want to replace the timing chain because I've read on the internet that they usually give out at 100K and with the thicker oil, I just don't think it will last any longer. Should I go for a thinner oil, if yes, which one do you recommend? and is there anything accept the timing chain I should get replaced too? The car also makes creaking noises from the back. The culprit for that IMHO are the rear bushings but my mechanic says that I shouldn't worry about those. Corolla: As I mentioned we bought the car from a guy who used the car as more of a secondary car. He had an amazing sound system in the car and it was more of a leisure car rather than a daily. According to him, he used Liqui Moly 10W-40 mos2 and the car didn't burn oil. He replaced the oil at 6000Km or 6 months. When I got the car, I'd heard about the 1zz oil burning issues and as the car was initially bought as a car to be kept in Faisalabad as we needed a car there. But, now it's coming back to Lahore as my daily. There isn't anything to do on the car except to replace the headlights with genuine ones as the ones on it right now are Depo and the guy who owned it had them opened and painted black and they've been repaired a bunch. I want to go for genuine lights because the depo ones also don't have the best angle for highway driving. I'd like to upgrade them to LEDs with the frost white hue (#FFFFFF color code). Could you recommend me a plug and play solution for the LEDs? I also read online that the 1zz also has timing chain issues, so the chain should be replaced at 120K.

Ask me anything about cars, maintenance, troubleshooting, or any automotive topic. I'm here to assist you! "}, {"role": "user", "content": "We currently own two cars, a Toyota Vitz F 1.0 2011 and a Toyota Corolla Altis 1.8 2006. We've owned the Vitz since 2015 and it is the daily driver of the house as my mother uses it to go to her job near Kasur everyday and is also used to get groceries, etc. The car has 185K on the odo, which haven't been tampered with. Bought the Corolla last year in October and got quite a few things done like the spark plugs (got the saday copper ones because of my mechanic asking me to get them before I go for iridium as saday suit the car better), valve cover gasket, axle boots, transmission fluid and air and oil filters changed. The car shows 133k on the clock but me and my driver, who's been with us for quite a while and generally knows about a lot of the tricks from the used car world as he also has contacts throughout Lahore, think that it's probably around 180k-200k. Vitz: The car has had it's CVT fluid changed at 80K intervals, has had a few throttle services and it's fan motor changed. The alternator gave out on me in May, 2022 but I was forced to get it repaired by " Jaan'nay wala who repairs Jerman ki gariyan" and he repaired it with the wrong alternator assy. (I think the car comes with the long one but they used the shorter one) and now I wears through belts every 6 months. It has been run on 20W-50 Petron (Changed at every 4000Km) and I've been meaning to switch it back to 5W-30 (I haven't figured out the brand but the best one that's not a gimmick.) or at the very least 5W-50 Taglon. Furthermore, I think the cars engine mounts are also giving out and they should be replaced. My driver agrees with me going for preventative maintenance but also wants to get the most out of the genuine part, because they are the best. He disagrees with me on switching back to a thinner oil grade as it would blow the short block up. The car has lifter tick it could be a side- effect of the thicker oil. I hate it with all my might. What can I do to get rid of it? The car runs fine on 20W-50 and I'm the only mechanically inclined one in my family, so I am a little afraid of switching to a thinner oil grade after the milage kiyoun kay head assembly dalwany ki gunjaish nahi hai aur amma ki gaari pay pangay laynay ka nuqsan malnorishment hou jaata hai. I also want to replace the timing chain because I've read on the internet that they usually give out at 100K and with the thicker oil, I just don't think it will last any longer. Should I go for a thinner oil, if yes, which one do you recommend? and is there anything accept the timing chain I should get replaced too? The car also makes creaking noises from the back. The culprit for that IMHO are the rear bushings but my mechanic says that I shouldn't worry about those. Corolla: As I mentioned we bought the car from a guy who used the car as more of a secondary car. He had an amazing sound system in the car and it was more of a leisure car rather than a daily. According to him, he used Liqui Moly 10W-40 mos2 and the car didn't burn oil. He replaced the oil at 6000Km or 6 months. When I got the car, I'd heard about the 1zz oil burning issues and as the car was initially bought as a car to be kept in Faisalabad as we needed a car there. But, now it's coming back to Lahore as my daily. There isn't anything to do on the car except to replace the headlights with genuine ones as the ones on it right now are Depo and the guy who owned it had them opened and painted black and they've been repaired a bunch. I want to go for genuine lights because the depo ones also don't have the best angle for highway driving. I'd like to upgrade them to LEDs with the frost white hue (#FFFFFF color code). Could you recommend me a plug and play solution for the LEDs? I also read online that the 1zz also has timing chain issues, so the chain should be replaced at 120K. Is there any other preventative maintenance? EDIT : I get my work done from Magic Motors Model Town."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "@Xulfiqar, I request your assistance!"}]}

I booked Toyota Corolla Altis X 1.6 AT on 5-4-2022 with initial booking of 1 Million and delivery by Oct 22. I then received message from company to deposit remaining 28.25M by end April to receive only 50% price increase in future which I deposited by 29 April 22. From April till Nov Corolla price fluctuated multiple times and company informed me that delivery may delay by 3 months and price may increase due to minor model change to which I gave an undertaking. In November 22, company disclosed that "All Corolla outstanding orders as of November 16 with full payments made by July 15, 2022 in accordance with terms and dates as per price circular of March 22, April 29 and August 15, 2022 will be required to pay the fixed price differential of Rs. 300,000 inclusive of 1% Capital Value Tax by November 25, 2022". In December I was asked by the company to deposit the balance payment of 530,000 Rs (300,000 fixed price difference+73,500 freight charges+50,000 WH tax+106,500 balance) making total payment of Rs 4,350,000/- against market price of Rs 5,100,000 approx as on 11 Jan,23. I deposited this as well. Then they asked to provide another undertaking that as I have accepted this above offer (which I believe is not as its part of initial deal to get 50% off on price increase) so I will not claim any interest / markup (it's KIBOR + 3% which I believe is my right to take as it's almost 8 months after initial booking now) or file a case on Indus motors or it's dealership etc otherwise company will not provide me original invoice (it's a kind of blackmailing).

Help apprciated!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Do inform me plz , if you still have it."}]}

So, About dalas in general, one thing you should know is that comfort is not what they are built for. Most dalas have leafspring suspension at the back and without any payload they tend to bounce around. Powerwise you can expect great torque from dalas. They can pick up and go from any speed when you put the pedal down. The beauty of a pickup truck is in its utility and robustness. you will feel this in the drive. It's a go anywhere car with utility like no other segment of car. I have a 2016-17, 3.0 D4D. And like you this is my 1st SUV or dala. I was looking for 2005 prados but when i sat in this model hilux my decision quickly shifted from old prado to this new dala. It's been 2.5 years since my decision and I am happy as can be. Love driving it. driven it on Mountains and in city. It's much better than vigo in comfort and feel and general design as well. If you can find a genuine 3.0 then it would cost a bit higher than your budget i.e. 90lack or so with mileage under 1lack kms (genuine). If you want more power you can tune hilux to get heap more torque and a lot more horsepower. I have not felt the need to do so yet. I only have a throttle controller installed which eliminates the turbo lag a bit. Also tons of aftermarket suspension available for revos. Optimal comfort can be achieved using reservoir shocks. p.s. 2016 PKDM hiluxes came with Thailand made suspension which is much more comfortable than the 2017 suspension made by agri autos in Pakistan. The local suspension has been stiffened to accommodate bigger payloads, i.e. lots of guards in back lol. Tundra is a bigger vehicle than hilux and parts will be an issue. Its going to be much more expensive to maintain and maneuver in the city as well. With hilux, i find it hard to find roads open enough to give it WOT. Let me know if you need any more info on 3.0 D4D hilux. I have a Revo i.e. fully loaded trim."}]}

It is a relatively new vehicle and will only require regular maintenance like air filters, fluids, brakes and tires.

The only downfall to the Sportage may be 5 seats Vs 7 in most prados. Unless you go mudding, or serious offroading. You don't need a true 4wd.

"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello everyone, I bought a 2013 Toyota Corolla 1.3 with a manual transmission a few months ago, but I'm dealing with a recurring problem. After driving the car for approximately 10 to 15 kilometers, I notice a significant drop in its performance. In the morning, when I initially start the car, everything seems fine, the acceleration is smooth and the pick is perfect. But as I drive a bit, the car's pick drops significantly. It even struggles to gain speed in 2nd gear at around 15 kmph, and sometimes I have to shift down to 1st gear just to get going. Also, when this happens after driving a bit, the fuel consumption goes from 14 15 to 7 8. Here's what my mechanic and I have tried so far: Replaced the fuel pump multiple times, now installed a bigger fuel pump and the fuel pressure is at 60. Changed to genuine Toyota spark plugs bought from the official Toyota dealership. Replaced the ignition coils to ensure there are no issues with spark leakage or misfires. Replaced the oxygen sensor. Replaced the accelerator pedal. Even did an engine overhaul due to its slight weakness and oil consumption, thinking it might help the power issue, but sadly, it's still there. I've been trying to fix this power problem for the last 2 to 3 months and came to a dead end.

New ones are usually available in the market from manufacturers like depo etc and are usually made in taiwan, china.

There are tons of videos on youtube on how to check this. If that's okay and you still aint satisfied, you can always get some good quality LED h11 bulbs for your low beams. Don't get those crap chinese ones though. Auxleds, Bi-led, novsight are some companies that make plug & play bulbs for cars (8-12k for a pair of h11 bulbs) here in Pakistan. Osram, phillips etc also make the same bulbs but they are double the price almost so it's upto you.

Motors wiring seems to be in good condition, never had big issues since the swap, besides couple of times had a problem of fuel cut when the motor used to get hot, for which I changed the fuel pump twice, however later realized that it was a bad wire patch from ecu to fuel pump. Recently one of the main wire (70 taara) from the battery to the fuse box had a burnt patch, wherein no current was passing to the radiator fan, lights, horn etc, changed that quickly. This might be due to the humid weather adding to the worsening of wiring setup. Thankyou for the advice brother, I'll recheck all of the motor's wirings once again, however the first thing to do today is check for the codes as advised earlier, in addition to changing old spark plugs, to rule them out as a suspect to rough idle and flooding."}]}

It started happening a couple weeks back, the light used to come up randomly during driving and went off after a couple seconds/ minutes with no changes in car behavior. So I got the wiring checked and other minor things but it didn't solve my issue and light kept on coming up and going out randomly. So one day the light came up and the race dropped and the car wasn't accelerating beyond 20-40kms.

Therr are way too many cons out there and when you find one good one, you will have to understand that project cars are in constant repair because they dont follow any manufacturer spec. The balance is how much time it spends in shop vs how much time it spends on road, and this is why you need to understand how exactly a car is put together, down to little nuts n bolts, so you can actually measure what you are recieving as work. E.g. older cars like e70 corolla have greasable suspension, wheel bearings and other parts like hinges etc, but no corolla after that, so it has more maintenance just with that. (Most new mechanics dont even know how to set the preload on wheel bearings anymore - so its best left for diy) Then comes the part that you have a 40 year old car, stuff will fail for sure, and at odd times unless you literally strip the car to bits and rebuild it 100% (which again requires 1st hand knowledge)"}]}

Your cars torque converter is literally damaged from the dumbass programming that toyota did, its a tiny clutch which toyota programmed to fully lock at abt 35 kmh which basically lugs it so bad that its static friction is overcome almost instantly, it overheats and warps out of shape which then causes dragging and shuddering as the flex lock adaptation comes into play.

New Altis CVT will be the same in comfort if it doesnt have the hard factory leather seat option but mileage will be better. It will incorporate fake shifts like Grande to get rid of rubberbanding effect which is typical in CVTs like Civic X. On the other hand, Altis 1.6 AT Special edition is also an option which has push start, climate control, sunroof and LED headlights like Grande."}]}

Pretty high number of afghans are located across europe & canada. They are into automotive scrap business dealing at dirt cheap buying whole warehouses full of such goods.

I see that is going to be nearly impossible to do in Pakistan. So we will try to eliminate what is NOT wrong, thereby leaving us with most probable causes. From what you have described, I would look into a few things. a. The bearings at Shock absorber mount. b. Check the brake calipers, some times they get stuck in awkward position due to dust etc on the pins. c, The sway bar bushing and sway bar ends. In order to kill the issue, lift the car up ( service shop or wash ), try moving and jerking. Lastly, try to oil up the sway bar bushing as well as sway bar ends, if the sound goes away, you know where it was coming from. regards."}]}

So @hash4u is right, almost > 90% of all Corolla models post 2002 have after-market compressors and mostly are Toyota Duet/Terios Kid etc. while after lift up of Lockdown of Covid-19, A/C markets in Karachi, Islamabad & Lahore are flooded with Mitsubishi Compressors so A/C walas are happy in swapping those. @Xulfiqar ,Right now used/ old/ Kabuli Mitsubishi Compressors in Pakistan are between 12K to 15K while these Terios Kid/ Duet(Denso brand) compressors are between 17K to 25K. Gas charging and associated Labor charges are ranging between at least 4K to 7K in Karachi. I am too disheartened to see this situation. Tried to compiled little sort of research in finding the basic reason behind those failures but could not complete it due to lack of time. Hope to get more time soon in future so that i can send emails to HVAC Manufacturers or at least to Car brands in Pakistan for pointing out this issue. Till now, 2 major factors what i have observed or reach out findings by discussion with more than 2 dozens of A/C walas of KHI and LHR: 1. Clogged Condenser due to Dirt, sand durst, mud. Of course due to poor road conditions in whole country but specially in Sindh & Balochistan, too much sand durst, dirt particles, micro waste materials are causing Condenser clogged almost daily. As per A/C walas, this factor contributes in high pressure disturbance which later i=on ended compressors, 2. High pressure Engine/ Compressor washing by Water For countering point 1, we are simply rushing to service stations where Labors used to pressure wash whole engine by high jet water dispenser pipes and particularly wash A/C Condenser and Compressors to make it clean from dirt and dust. (This includes service facilities at 3S Dealers too). In this practice, water/ moisture used to enter these Compressors and causes severe damages Later on. These rotary/ screw/ scroll type/ pwm valve based Compressors are very sensitive and this moisture and water washing is causing them bad otherwise they can run for more time. 3. Dirty Car floor mats which are filled with tons of dirt and dust due to our shoes running daily on broken roads are also causing cabin filter and other a/c components choked. @pwuser14958616851 you can contact Dmotorsports @dani_kk or @rajaatta in RWP/ ISB for your A/C issues."}]}

I had Michelins with over 90k kms with similar dry rotted condition and they still would hold up air and wouldn't lose grip in wet. They were hard and noisy and I had one opened up for repairs (minor puncture) and on the inside it was very good condition. Dry rot is mostly on the outer (tread) surface, there are atleast 3 to 4 internal layers of rubber and mesh for structural integrity.. I would say surface dry rot is not a big deal just keep the air pressure in check (30-32psi) and make sure none of the tyres loses air. If you can live with the noise and don't go over 80 and 100 on highways these should be fine for few trips per month. Changing tyres is a necessity only when there are safety concerns, major side wall damage, or they are more than 5-year old. But if you have money to buy new then it's your choice, I have seen people change oils in cars within 6 months with 500-1000km mileage. And some drive over 10k kms and change maybe once a year.. it is all good just a matter of peace of mind."}]}

All combustion engines produce exhaust smoke. c. The reason you are able to see diesel's is because of it's color. d. The black smoke is due to fuel not burnt fully. e. (d) can be due to lack of enough air, or too much fuel, f. if the car has the thermostat valve, and it is working fine, then go to following steps. Start by checking air filter's health, make sure you are not choking the engine. Check the fuel filter's health, make sure it is clean and allows free flow. Next comes the nozzles, that is done together with the following step, keep reading: Lastly, get your pump calibrated properly. The diesel pump may be twisted ( mechanics wrongly do that with hand ) and call it timing. It basically sets the stroke depth of the router, and controls the amount of fuel that is allowed in the cylinder. too much fuel will cause black smoke and burn your pistons. While you are getting the pump checked, also do the nozzles, Check the manufacturer release pressure on the nozzles you have. the nozzles are mounted on the test pump one by one, and you have to check at what pressure do they release; healthy nozzles will make a chirping sound. PS: 99.9999% mechanics will fail to do this properly, and their pressure calibration is not accurate at all. Hope that helps . Regards."}]}

Additionally, inspect the ignition coils and ignition cables for any signs of damage or wear. Air Intake System: Check the air filter to ensure it's clean and not obstructed. A dirty or clogged air filter can restrict airflow to the engine, affecting its performance. Engine Sensors: Faulty or malfunctioning sensors, such as the mass airflow sensor (MAF) or oxygen sensors, can impact fuel efficiency and starting performance. Consider having these sensors checked and replaced if necessary. Battery and Electrical System: Ensure that the battery is in good condition and the terminals are clean and secure.

I know Alto is not to be compared with Revo but in principal if the oil gets too thin and fails to lubricate that's an issue. I have seen consistency of 0w20 and its super thin. whatever oil is used, it should be changed on specified intervals to prevent sludge buildup. I recommend usage of products like engine flush, and ceratech as additional layers of security over the oil protection. p.s. i own both Revo and Alto.

The fuel trims for Bank 2 are ok but for bank 1 its still running rich, if i keep the rpm low and at a constant speed then the fuel trims get normal around 0to5+- but when stop and go or floor it the fuel trims mostly the bank 2 go a negative 22.

I took my cousin’s altis 1.6(1zr fe) to inter city travel and it gave me easily 16+km/l average with utilisation of power on passing other cars. Car was full of luggage in trunk and 5 people were sitting including driver and AC was on full blast all time. And if you have real budget issues the 1nz is also good engine and performance would be on depend on luck to find a good one. And also have no idea about the latest rates of these engines. Last time may be month age hot quote of 155,000 for 1nz complete engine with CVT transmission it was just quote on phone didn’t saw engine in person. 1zr is bolt on fit in 2010 model as facelift model 2011 come with same 1zr fe engine in altis and gli 1.6 automatic."}]}

It's a dumb idea to go for a vehicle that you already know all of its current maintenance history/reliability to a vehicle that's 15 yrs with question marks everywhere. You won't know if it's accidental, meter reversed or if the battery and engine and such are truly 100% which is HIGHLY doubted. You don't know what kind of engine oil they used, what viscosity they used, what change interval they used, how often they changed their air filter, whether they changed the engine coolant, whether brake fluid service has been done, spark plugs? If you have a complete maintenance history with confirmation that the vehicle is mechanically sound AND you're getting a good deal, then you can think about it. But imo, switching from a newer vehicle to an older vehicle is not a good choice. I did it with our 2014 vezel to a 2006 shogun, only because the vezel was terrible and a reliability nightmare in our ownership."}]}

Reinsert the dipstick fully into the transmission, making sure it goes all the way in. - 6. Remove the dipstick again and observe the oil level. The dipstick will usually have two marks indicating the minimum and maximum levels. The ideal level should be between these two marks. - 7. If the oil level is low, you will need to add gear oil. Slowly pour the specified gear oil (in your case GL4 75w90) into the transmission through the dipstick tube. Use a funnel to avoid spills. - 8. Recheck the oil level using the dipstick to ensure it is within the acceptable range. - 9. Once you have achieved the correct level, securely reinsert the dipstick back into the transmission. - 10. Close the hood and you're done! -  - Make sure to consult your vehicle's manual for the exact oil specifications and any specific instructions related to checking and filling the gear oil."}]}

The machanic was talking in the air, as he diagnosed that the misaligned disc and hub are the route cause of said unwanted friction between disc and breakpads and my guess was that the spindle mounts are looks slightly misaligned and must be the cause of sticky breaks but the issue was with bad calipers which has been replaced with the Kabli sourced one but still I doubt that the wheels are 100 percent free from any friction or drage... Pls advice."}]}

The issue was the loose feeling of steering, as well as a clunking noise when driving over a bumpy surface. I visited the mechanic and he diagnosed that there is play in the rack. He then went to adjust/tight the steering rack which for the time being solved the issue. But after almost 10k KMs, the issue again arose. Then the mechanic suggested replacing the rack with the kabali one. Then again after the same interval issue was there again, was then replaced the rack with a new china one recently a few months back. Now the play in the rack is back, which causes the car to produce clunking noise and loose steering which makes it hard to drive at high speed. What I deduced is the rack is going bad after almost 10-15k KMs. I need your suggestions on what could be the real cause that is destroying the rack so early.

There are no other mechanical abnormalities as such, the car drives smoothly and the suspension seems to be fine (Installed new Agriauto shocks too).

Corolla steering itself is very soft, if you call soft steering as loose then I guess you are wrong. If you are considering wavy/floaty car at high speeds then this can be an issue other then steering rack. Ruptured boot of Tie rod ends or sway bar links can make you feel that car is floating on higher speeds, they can also produce clunking noise.

And so in case the file is lost then the owner applies for a duplicate at the E&T and is issued a "duplicate" that's basically a photocopy of the docs from their record with "duplicate" stamped on it. And that results in significant drop in resale value. I think other provinces have pretty much the same practice. Now, you have a big problem. Why? Because 1) it would be very difficult to find a buyer who would want to spend money on a car without documents. It is a bit of a deadend investment for him. 2) even if you did find one...you will incur a significant loss when it comes to sale price. 3) the car shall stay on your name since the docs are missing and it won't be transferred to the new owner so if the car gets involved in any illegal activities then you are the registered owner as per E&T records. Now that was the bad news... How can you deal with this... 1) keep the car!! treat it as a family member and don't get rid of it. It's a nice handy car with good fuel economy and so stick with it. 2) if you must sell it then sell it to a trusted relative/good friend and inform them about the issue. Sell it below market price and buy back when they want to sell it. Basically keep it in the family."}]}

Can be any of the following: Air filter housing not seated properly, rubber gasket between intake pipe and throttle body is damaged, throttle body gasket is damaged, intake manifold to head rubber gasket is leaky, engine breather or PCV valve hose is leaking vaccum, brake booster line or the brake booster itself is leaking vaccum. My bets are on throttle body side gaskets as the local ustaads love to give it a carb cleaner ghusal as a ritual, all in the name of "behtreen sarvis". Dismantling it frequently causes the gaskets to leak vaccum, as they never replace them (and rather destory them with carb cleaner aswell).

My expereince and conclusion says that: Its pure owner's choice what should be the best to him/her as per him/her requirements in terms of following factors preference-wise: 1. Budget Limit 2. Transmission choice. As per your health e.g. If owner or other driver(s) at your home driving your car have joint pain issues or other problems like backache or arthritis or some other orthopedic problems or any issue else, then one should convert to Automatic Transmission for ease 3. Availability of skilled resources(Good workshops/ Mechanics) 4. Availability of parts 5. Mood of keeping it near to stock like Factory spec. or likes modifications as per nature/mood or want to modernize it as per new era/ new Tech 6. Is your vehicle daily ride or it is using as 2nd or 3rd car at your home 7. Do you have interest or you can afford frequent Visits to car mechanics, electricians, denter, painter, Axle workshops, A/C shops, Suspension uncle etc. (Here afford means both Time-wise as well as Cost-wise) 8. What is your family requirement of this vehicle? If one is using this car for taking any family member or friend to hospital, therapy center then ofcourse, peace of mind will stay with as much as stock as possible. 9. How much are you concerned about Fuel Savvy as per your budget/ salary etc. Of course, in long run it will be a major factor. So after calculating all factors, then decide what is best for you, your pocket and the most important to your family"}]}

Yes these are minimum factors to be considered.

However after complete overhaul, now i am considering 2 to 3 new factors i.e. Road/Traffic Jam in Karachi plus pain in my knees plus future planning of relaxing/ ease factor as per my age, i am planning to replace original Manual Tranny with Automatic Transmission in near future. Here now my priority is my ease, my health but in parallel at the same time, i will have to compromise on Fuel mileage/ Average but of course it has lesser priority in compare to above 3 priorities.

A 1.5 Yaris I currently own is basically a Corolla Axio in disguise. Despite that, after 10 minutes of driving, my upper back starts to hurt even properly setting the seat with proper tire pressure. The second issue is with its bright interior, where the rear window gets blinded due to the beige surface below, the silver painted parts next to the multimedia get reflected on my eyes, and the gauges get covered by sunlight which I never experienced on any vehicle before, it's annoying and almost dangerous to drive during daylight. I applied interior cleaner that gives a matt finish which at least does the job. The third issue is the lack of cruise control. Unless you're getting a manual version or driving in manual mode, it's going to be very difficult driving at cruising speeds, especially on highways, since it has a CVT. It's possible to install cruise control, but this is something I would not do since it isn't plug-and-play. Overall, it's a good car but somewhat comfortable and with a gimmicky interior. The strange thing is that I feel more comfortable on my old manual Swift despite it having a stiff drive. As for Corolla Grande, it has more interior space obviously, but I didn't feel tired driving it. It has cruise control, a sunroof, and even a rear foldable seat which is very useful for carrying large stuff, even the new Civic doesn't have one which is absolutely insane.

My cousin is having altis 2017 facelift it has clocked 165000kms so far it take little to blow completely cold air we have got it checked from AC technician he said refrigerant is low but so minor reductions is there that he didn’t recommend us to get it charged as recharging may lead to Compressor failure and that’s most common with 10th and 11th generation Corollas. BTW I own 2015 gli auto it’s AC working fine it is using clutch type AC compressor so I have no cooling issues it only struggles cooling cabin if car war parked in direct sunlight but if it’s parked under shade or tree it cooling perfectly if temperature outside scorching also in karachi 35 temperature is quite hot because of humidity and coastal areas have more scorching sunshine than any other country as UV damage to plastic parts are very high in karachi."}]}

(For those who want a shorter read, see the 10th paragraph directly.) In Feb 2021, we bought Altis 1.6x from Toyota Islamabad Motors and it was among the first batch of the ‘X’ variants of Altis. On 24th December 2022, my parents were on their way back from Sargodha to Rawalpindi. After entering the Motorway M2 using SIAL INTERCHANGE, they noticed a yellow light on the cluster and the thermostat meter fell down below the zero mark (Picture that my dad sent me on WhatsApp immediately is attached). Taking it to be an electrical malfunction and considering the young age of the car, I advised them to stop at the nearest Rest station and contact the motorway assistance team. The hour was near sunset and fog was on its way. After merely travelling for 5-7 Kms, the car stopped in the middle of the motorway . Our driver was able to manoeuvre the car to safety saving his own and my parent’s life. Not being able to figure out what had happened, they called the motorway assistance team. They took around 1-2 Hours to reach just to tell us our engine had ‘SEIZED’. The team said they could try to fix the issue by changing the engine oil, and charged us 4500 for the oil to see if it would work. They even tried refilling the radiator. But obviously if it had worked, I wouldn’t be writing this post. Shocked to our guts, we referred to our Warranty card which said Toyota is responsible for a 3 year or 100,000km warranty (Our car fully fits the criteria). I advised my parents to get a Tow truck (Charged 25k) and take the car to Toyota Sargodha Motors which was the nearest available ‘authorised’ center to claim warranty and figure the problem out. Two days passed as it was the weekend, and on Monday a random supervisor at Toyota Sargodha Motors denied our warranty ‘without giving any reason’ and offered us a ‘Kabuli Engine’ from their own dealership worth 3.5 Lacs. We obviously denied getting a Kabuli engine from an authorised dealership in a car worth 50 lacs. I immediately contacted Toyota Indus Motors via Email, and they responded after a day saying my issue will be resolved. It is important to note that this was 26/27 December (Monday/Tuesday). They took one and a half week to get me aligned with their ‘Technical team’. MOST IMPORTANT POINT: On the next Wednesday, a person named Shehbaz came from Lahore to survey the vehicle. He told me that the car had overheated which led to the engine seizure. The person told us that the cause of overheating was that there was no water in the radiator. I am attaching a picture with this post which will prove that the radiator bottle still had water even after reaching Toyota Sargodha. He said a water stain could be seen on the inside of the bonnet, and made an assumption that ‘probably’ the radiator cap was left open. It is important to note we have always maintained our car at Toyota since the start. In fact, we had the last oil change 2 weeks before at Toyota Sargodha Motors. We have been driving different cars for 25 years and we are careful enough not to open the main radiator airtight cap unless extremely necessary (You are supposed to see the transparent bottle that shows low and high levels of the coolant and keep the other one airtight). Our driver doesn’t get the car key except when he is with us. Even if the car did get heated, the thermostat meter had malfunctioned and it didn’t show that the engine was getting overheated for any reason. And this person was checking the car after roughly 2 weeks, how is a water splash supposed to stay there after 2 weeks? (And here’s the funny part: Roughly 1 week after this inspection when we opened the bonnet again, there was no stain. HIGH POSSIBILITY THAT THEY HAD MARKED THE STAIN THEMSELVES. But I won’t blame them for mere ‘assumptions’.) After getting the last oil change from Toyota (just 11 days before), we didn’t even open our car’s bonnet so how is a radiator cap even supposed to get lose all by itself? After a lot of mental stress and calls from Toyota Indus, we couldn’t take more. We had been without a car for 1 whole month using public transport and other means. Toyota never gave us a straight denial until almost 1 month after the incidence. This is the reason they had attached to the email: “Please note that your vehicle has been inspected by our IMC Technical Team and it has been concluded that the cause of damage is not due to any manufacturing defect in the product but may have been caused due to any external effects and alterations. As a result, it cannot be covered under warranty. However, as a token of goodwill, we would like to offer you 10% discount on the total repair cost of vehicle if the vehicle will be repaired at Toyota’s authorized dealership.” I am attaching a picture of the total estimate they gave us (PKR 490,000/-). They are literally offering us a lollipop of 40,000 out of the real 5 lac fraud. Hand on heart and as Allah as a witness, I can assure you that not a single mechanic has touched our car apart from Authorised Toyota Dealerships. We have always spent more than required just to have the mental peace. We have brought our non-functional car back from the dirt house of Toyota Sargodha and parked it at our home to have the mental peace. We are now sending the company a Legal Notice and filing a complaint at the Ministry of Ombudsman. After 20+ years of a relationship with Toyota, this is what we get. And this is what probably all of you will get as well if you choose Toyota. I urge all of you to get yourselves out of this Toyota mentality, as spending millions on a corolla isn’t worth it anymore."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "in PK new car warranty means to piss off the customer to the extent they run away themselves"}]}

Two days passed as it was the weekend, and on Monday a random supervisor at Toyota Sargodha Motors denied our warranty ‘without giving any reason’ and offered us a ‘Kabuli Engine’ from their own dealership worth 3.5 Lacs. We obviously denied getting a Kabuli engine from an authorised dealership in a car worth 50 lacs. I immediately contacted Toyota Indus Motors via Email, and they responded after a day saying my issue will be resolved. It is important to note that this was 26/27 December (Monday/Tuesday). They took one and a half week to get me aligned with their ‘Technical team’. MOST IMPORTANT POINT: On the next Wednesday, a person named Shehbaz came from Lahore to survey the vehicle. He told me that the car had overheated which led to the engine seizure. The person told us that the cause of overheating was that there was no water in the radiator. I am attaching a picture with this post which will prove that the radiator bottle still had water even after reaching Toyota Sargodha. He said a water stain could be seen on the inside of the bonnet, and made an assumption that ‘probably’ the radiator cap was left open. It is important to note we have always maintained our car at Toyota since the start. In fact, we had the last oil change 2 weeks before at Toyota Sargodha Motors. We have been driving different cars for 25 years and we are careful enough not to open the main radiator airtight cap unless extremely necessary (You are supposed to see the transparent bottle that shows low and high levels of the coolant and keep the other one airtight). Our driver doesn’t get the car key except when he is with us. Even if the car did get heated, the thermostat meter had malfunctioned and it didn’t show that the engine was getting overheated for any reason. And this person was checking the car after roughly 2 weeks, how is a water splash supposed to stay there after 2 weeks? (And here’s the funny part: Roughly 1 week after this inspection when we opened the bonnet again, there was no stain. HIGH POSSIBILITY THAT THEY HAD MARKED THE STAIN THEMSELVES. But I won’t blame them for mere ‘assumptions’.) After getting the last oil change from Toyota (just 11 days before), we didn’t even open our car’s bonnet so how is a radiator cap even supposed to get lose all by itself? After a lot of mental stress and calls from Toyota Indus, we couldn’t take more. We had been without a car for 1 whole month using public transport and other means. Toyota never gave us a straight denial until almost 1 month after the incidence. This is the reason they had attached to the email: “Please note that your vehicle has been inspected by our IMC Technical Team and it has been concluded that the cause of damage is not due to any manufacturing defect in the product but may have been caused due to any external effects and alterations.

He said a water stain could be seen on the inside of the bonnet, and made an assumption that ‘probably’ the radiator cap was left open. It is important to note we have always maintained our car at Toyota since the start. In fact, we had the last oil change 2 weeks before at Toyota Sargodha Motors. We have been driving different cars for 25 years and we are careful enough not to open the main radiator airtight cap unless extremely necessary (You are supposed to see the transparent bottle that shows low and high levels of the coolant and keep the other one airtight). Our driver doesn’t get the car key except when he is with us. Even if the car did get heated, the thermostat meter had malfunctioned and it didn’t show that the engine was getting overheated for any reason. And this person was checking the car after roughly 2 weeks, how is a water splash supposed to stay there after 2 weeks? (And here’s the funny part: Roughly 1 week after this inspection when we opened the bonnet again, there was no stain. HIGH POSSIBILITY THAT THEY HAD MARKED THE STAIN THEMSELVES. But I won’t blame them for mere ‘assumptions’.) After getting the last oil change from Toyota (just 11 days before), we didn’t even open our car’s bonnet so how is a radiator cap even supposed to get lose all by itself? After a lot of mental stress and calls from Toyota Indus, we couldn’t take more. We had been without a car for 1 whole month using public transport and other means. Toyota never gave us a straight denial until almost 1 month after the incidence. This is the reason they had attached to the email: “Please note that your vehicle has been inspected by our IMC Technical Team and it has been concluded that the cause of damage is not due to any manufacturing defect in the product but may have been caused due to any external effects and alterations. As a result, it cannot be covered under warranty. However, as a token of goodwill, we would like to offer you 10% discount on the total repair cost of vehicle if the vehicle will be repaired at Toyota’s authorized dealership.” I am attaching a picture of the total estimate they gave us (PKR 490,000/-). They are literally offering us a lollipop of 40,000 out of the real 5 lac fraud. Hand on heart and as Allah as a witness, I can assure you that not a single mechanic has touched our car apart from Authorised Toyota Dealerships. We have always spent more than required just to have the mental peace. We have brought our non-functional car back from the dirt house of Toyota Sargodha and parked it at our home to have the mental peace. We are now sending the company a Legal Notice and filing a complaint at the Ministry of Ombudsman. After 20+ years of a relationship with Toyota, this is what we get. And this is what probably all of you will get as well if you choose Toyota. I urge all of you to get yourselves out of this Toyota mentality, as spending millions on a corolla isn’t worth it anymore."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Extremely sorry for ur loss .but its not the case with Toyotas only i have gone through warranty claim experience myself with Suzuki.it was so torturing experience tht i had to sell my suzuki cultus 2018 only 20000 driven."}]}

If it's 96 and is a custom auction then it's correct because the vehicle auctioned by customs never ever goes without model details. Now comes the issue of is the chassis is petrol cairient or diesel this can be searched on UKDM sites as this chassis number starting from JT is usually comes from Europe or any pacific country. Jdm always uses the correct code like HDJ80 FZJ80 etc. Plus what evee the chassis is if it's custom auction then it doesn't matters that it is either diesel or petrol because one who is our hing the vehicle should spend a fortune to make it road worthy. And as you stated the chassis is painted that fortune has already been done so verify the documents from excise if registered and before transferring the vehicle on your name or before the purchase go for the forensic laboratory test if the chassis number to avoid any inconveniences on the future. If the vehicle is unregistered and auctioned from customs the previous owner is responsible to get it registered and there you can confirm the auctioned document integrity are they genuine or not from the concerned auctioned place or any custom house which is near you. If it's city auctioned it will be verified on the same day if it's auctioned off from any other city you need to spend some rs to confirm. In both cases it's a good deal.

I am experiencing a problem where there is excessive vibration in the steering wheel and body when I drive it at high speeds, around 90 or above. The whole vehicle shakes and it becomes uncomfortable. I have already checked the wheel alignment and had proper balancing done, but it did not make much of a difference. After balancing, the vibrations started occurring at speeds higher than 80. Surprisingly, when I reach a speed of 120, the vibrations reduce. I consulted a mechanic who initially suggested that the wheels might be defective, but the balancing expert confirmed that the wheels are fine. Now the mechanic is saying that it could be an issue with the suspension. He mentioned a possible leak in the suspension but after checking one of the wheels, it seemed to be in good condition. I am not sure what the exact problem is. If anyone has any knowledge about this, please contact me at 03206459410. The mechanic thinks it could be an issue with the suspension, but it is not severely damaged. If any mechanic brother has any idea, please guide me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Diagnosing vehicle vibration is one of the most difficult things to do and requires step by step diagnostics. a. Check your tyres. are they bent ? are they of the correct load and speed ratings. These are 2 different ratings. b. Check your wheels. you will need to remove the tyres, mount the wheels on a lathe and test them with a dial guage. c. Check the engine mounts, specially the gear mount. 4. Check the engine itself , if there is a case of misfire (unlikely but still worth a check ). 5. Check the propeller shaft and it's center bearing mount. 6. Check the universal joints. 7. Visit a professional balancing workshop, most of these people don't have any idea of what they are doing. Regards."}]}

Or shall i change it back As PSO oil change guy said its fine no problem to have this Second thing is that I tried PSO DEO 8000 15w-40 oil not Delo Gold, and it bought from company operated PSO station So is it fine to use PSO DEO 8000 as long i buy it from company operated stations? Any big difference frok Caltex? As someone told me that PSO has improved their quality much more Kindly give some guidance about filter and oil P.S i change exactly after 5,000 not less than that as taught by @Xulfiqar I am also attaching pic of that filter for reference As you can see in pictures filter is bigger, it had smaller in previous refill"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And what about tha filter’s question i asked?"}]}

Pakistan has to curb imports and the LCs will continue to face issues in future being released so i do not think prices will come down much.

I would still recommend you to do a pre purchase inspection before getting the car or agreeing to something.

Hilux has 6 way auto driver seat so learning your desired positioning helps with comfort (keep a soft cushion under seat as well if need be only to get used to). I raise the seat almost all the way as i like to sit up high and then hilux seats become a chair so one can get comfortable. After daily driving hilux i feel claustrophobic and vulnerable in a car. I love driving the Hilux. I recently got a small 660 to go to office etc and hilux is now a secondary car. This is due to parking issues and maneuverability in city. My car is a bit less bouncy due to thai shocks and front end lift but agri auto shocks (stock pakistani shocks) are too hard. There is a world of aftermarket available for these cars (shocks and accessories) and you can customize. I don't think you will get bored of it easily. I also suggest to visit pakwheels and see the selling value of 2020 hiluxes and then decide buying price. I personally would not get a fortuner due to mileage."}]}

His main motive is to buy a civic and a small car instead of keeping one hilux. I think you're probably right about adjusting the seat. I'll probably get another test drive so that I can have a good idea of the vehicle. How much do shocks generally cost? You said you had thai shocks. Mainly there is a huge market that sells Kabli shocks but again I'll probably need to research on it. I checked the price of getting it facelifted to Rocco and the estimate came somewhere around 190k. The tyre replacement would cost 160k. I personally don't like the Pakwheels app in terms of selling as there is a range of seller who demand an exorbitantly high price than the market, most of which are dealers. On top of that, the market these days isn't really much active. The cost of new hilux listed was around 140lac which seems pretty high as there is registration cost on top of it. There are vehicles which were invoiced in September and October 2021 and they haven't been sold yet. I think I'll think hard before making a decision as I'm pretty happy with Civic but just wanted to try a 4x4 as I never had one. Shocks can cost from 150k to 200k. There is a second hand market for these as well. check ADz performance. Extreme 4x4 is another shop to check out in Karachi they ship all over pakistan. In 2016 dec hiluxes, due to lack of localization toyota was using Thai shocks so i got lucky. You can get thai shocks in kabli market as well. As far as researching cars on Pakwheels is concerned you can set the perimeter as (low to high price) and quote the lowest good looking price to negotiate."}]}

In the AC system, there is a recurring fault where the AC trips after running for some time. However, by turning the AC off using the button inside and then turning it on again, the AC starts functioning correctly. The root cause of this problem typically lies with the compressor solenoid. Unfortunately, in Pakistan, the solenoid is not readily available as a separate part, so the entire compressor needs to be replaced to resolve the issue."}]}

I am looking for a good mechanic in Islamabad/Rawalpindi who understands the 2ZZ engine well. I recently got the engine swapped in my corolla and got a custom air intake made since then the engine has been losing power on low RPMs (Below 1500) and the fuel average isn't great too. My guess is the air intake and placement of the MAF sensor is the issue. Any advice or a recommendation on the mechanic would be nice. Thank you"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2 contributors of PW have their workshop @dani_kk in Islamabad @rajaatta in Rawalpindi click the IDs' and you can connect with both who ever is close by."}]}

Rates are more or less the same in Peshawar, however charging for an original one and providing a Chinese product is common practice these days. The rates of these remotes and the cost of making differs from car to car also. To avoid the above scenario, its better to opt for a Chinese product and negotiate to get a better deal. I usually get these things done from the auto markets around kabutar chowk on ring road (https://goo.gl/maps/7BhwqsRyVPy6zMz19).

I was quoted like 6 in tehkal and around that much in various places in Saddar, and that's just the remote's price. The place I visited gave me an original remote, set it up and everything, gave me a dogshit cover for it (more on that later) and made a great duplicate physical key for 4,000. The plastic remote cover itself is a cheap chinese knock off that barely gets the job done. The buttons are really unreliable and could easily be triggered when inside your pocket. It's not that big of a deal since it's just a spare remote and I'll find a good cover if I ever lose my original one. The place I visited is called "The Car Decor & Accessories". At least that's what it's called on the receipt they gave me. The blue sign on top said "Sony Electronics & Car Decor", so there's that. Maybe it wasn't theirs or an older/newer name. Idk. Pics of the remote for comparison. The only difference I could spot was that in pic 4, there's "B 1" on my original remote and "B 3" on this one"}]}

It involves depositing or layering materials onto a surface to enhance its properties or provide additional functionalities. The nanocoating technology is capable of enhancing various characteristics of the coated surface, such as durability, protective abilities, scratch resistance, water repellency, or even self-cleaning properties. It finds applications in different industries, including electronics, automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and textiles, among others."}]}

Using a tracking service is also an option. There are chinese gps devices that can be fitted in cars and a sim card is installed to keep track of the car. Companies and insurance companies do it too.

I will try to explain a few points you should consider before starting the exercise. I assume you got the basics covered such as air filter, fuel filter etc. A car's fuel average dependent on several things, such as Car's tyres. Engine health Fuel combustion Point number 3, has several other aspects that I will discuss later in this post Car's Tyres. Please understand your car's tyres are the single most important thins when it comes to safety and economy. People buy tyres, not knowing what they are buying and why they are buying it. That said almost all tyres in Pakistan are low quality smuggled and the government does not regulate this sector at all. The traction rating of the tyre determines how good the tyre grasps the road, and thus determines how fuel efficient the car will be. If you have bad tyres, or tyres with wrong thread pattern, you will NEVER get good fuel economy. Secondly, please pay attention to the amount of air in the tyres, Pakistani |ustaads| mostly over inflate the tyre, which causes lack of traction. Some people change the car's suspension and ride height, NEVER do such things. Engine Health This is a very complex subject and requires detailed knowledge, suffice to say that an old / sick engine cannot give you good fuel economy. no matter what you do and where you go it just will not happen. Everything from valve sealing, to piston health, to cylinder health come under question. People who go to cheap ill qualified "Ustaads" to maintain or rebuild engines to save a few thousand end up wasting 100 times more in terms of fuel and time loss. If you lay will dogs, you will rise with fleas Combustion Health This is where most people seems to be having problem. Lets go one by one in diagnostics. The throttle body is responsible for allowing the correct amount of fuel and air mixture and the ignition system is responsible for combusting it properly. Throttle body is controlled by the computer via the throttle position sensor (input) and the iVAC (output) and the oxygen sensor ( input ) To keep things simple I will not discuss EGR and other emission control system in this post. There is very little you can do to change the way the computer works, except for making sure that the sensors are working fine and the associated wiring is healthy. Next come the fuel distribution that consists of the fuel pump, fuel return valve and fuel injectors. The pump is supposed to maintain a certain pressure in the fuel distribution line; every car has it's own OEM recommended pressure. please consult that before doing anything. If the fuel return valve is faulty this system will not work _if the vacuum system has leaks, this system will not work. _ if the emission control piping has leaks, this system will not work because the fuel tank won't be able to release vacuum. Now look at the spark plugs. always use the proper recommended plugs that sit will with the OEM recommendations. all plugs are not the same, and they have certain resistance and impedance at high RPM. You have to use the right HT wires with the proper plugs. Also note that using a metal blade to adjust gap is WRONG. you need a feeler gauge as that gap is crucial. Next look at the fuel injectors, they can get clogged over time, and they can get tired since the fuel is released in a combination of solenoid and mechanical valve. Please don't assume a new valve will automatically be alright. it must be calibrated before usage. Secondly NEVER use used parts. they will ultimately cause more loss in the long run. NONE of our local "ustaads" have the equipment or the knowledge and skill to perform this job right. Next look at the engine's timings. Rotating the distributor is NOT the correct way to do this job. the ignition sequence has to be at the right fraction of the second synchronized with the piston's TDC position at the compression stroke. You need a timing gun to do this job right otherwise you are injecting correct fuel, but igniting it before the piston reaches it's optimal compression and the valves are all closed to squeeze power from combustion. DO THIS JOB RIGHT ! Gentlemen One things that determines fuel efficiency more than anything else is your DRIVING STYLE. If you drive with a heavy foot, your car will burn fuel, if you keep it gentle and keep the RPM low, it will be economical. The above is for gasoline cars, and not 100% complete. I have omitted some details as they are too technical. Please understand it is a game of right fuel to air mixture and burning it properly. Lastly, before you start you exercise please check what the car is capable of, and you don't end up in a wild goose chase. Keep your targets reasonable and you will be fine. Regards."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Absolutely correct. Its the whole concept of uniform motion. you don't need to accelerate, and thus no extra fuel is required except for what is required."}]}

"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Dear Friends, I have been struggling with 'cold start' in my Toyota corolla XE Saloon 1998 - Manual transmission (4EFE) for quite sometime. A mechanic fixed the problem by cleaning the throttle body, however the problem resurfaced, despite replacing fuel pump, temperature sensor, spark plugs. This time mechanic replaced the entire throttle body with a different one, but this has a constant RPM even after engines reached its normal temperature, which also means more fuel consumption (looks like a quick fix). I am looking for a competent mechanic/auto electrician in Islamabad/Rawalpindi who can resolve this problem. Some key facts are below: 1. Car hesitates on cold start./rough idling until normal temperature is reached. 2. Once engines reaches normal temperature, rough idling stops, even after restarting engine. 2. Engine occasionally shuts down while driving which is very dangerous (only when neutral). 3. Occasional missing. 4. Engine does not give any smoke.

No other Car of the same category can match its fuel economy. Moreover a newer car has comparatively far less maintainance charges than an old car with bigger engine.

Then my vote is for 1.6 Altis."}]}
