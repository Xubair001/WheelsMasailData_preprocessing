textdata: Normally swapped kabli engines go bad at early just because the oil sitting in the oil rings appear like a grease and sometimes oil rings get stuck, engine starts eating oil. Normally if engine is less used and super clean which is hard to find, but it works well.|~~|~~|~~|But km interval is better of new parts|~~|~~|~~|Just for example I bought a car with a nissan QG18de was in good nick and owner was using 5w30. It was super duper for 60k-80k km in 3-4years of my usage and then started consuming oil. Since the damage was on early stages, I opened it up and found out the ring gap is good aswell as valves and cams, however oil ring was stuck, so I installed seal package, new oil pump, new water pump and new standard piston rings, new con rod journals and new mls Nissan headgasket and new adjuster. Earlier engine was giving 170psi compression, however after doing this precautionary maintenance I got 185-187psi compression, however my engine has 192psi of factory compression so I moved close to it.|~~|~~|~~|So if you buy kabli assembly and if you feel any abnormalities just install new parts like this you will be less prone to engine failure soon and can pull good miles of a junkyard engine.

textdata: Thanks for detailed reply! I did instal kabuli 2sz fe four years ago it did run 90000km . Now it consumes quart of oil after 4k kms 5w30 . Also apparent metallic sound from upper part of engine which according to mechanic is of timing chain plus tensioner issue . I was given advised to run engine on thicker oil like 5w40 to prolong duration before final overhauling . I never buy this logic and now thinking to go for earlier overhauling. Question is if original parts of 2sz engine available and what would be cost ? Kabuli half assembly I don't like because we have no standard procedure to know exact mileage and condition of engine internals .|~~|~~|~~|@dani_kk @rajaatta

textdata: toyota workshop manual.|~~|~~|~~|and if you tear down the gearbox to look inside you will see that the 5th gear relies on the gear oil splashing by the rest of the gearsets - if the level is low (like half liter or so) it will run dry, This is common knowledge since transverse mounted powertrain front wheel drive cars became common in the 70s and 80s

textdata: Hello everyone|~~|~~|~~|I want to buy my first car and I have saved 25 to 30 lac for it. I live in a hilly area, so I need a bigger car. Some people are suggesting that instead of getting the GLI 1.3, I should consider the Altis 1.6 because it has better fuel efficiency and the air conditioning works well. A friend of mine who owns a newer GLI 1.3 complains that the AC only cools the front seats properly. I would like to ask the community for their guidance based on their personal experiences with these cars. Also, I'm looking for an automatic car. Thanks!

textdata: You are facing some issues in the variator pressure - When mechanics apply grease to the axles and shove them in the transmission by force - the grease can adulterate the oil badly - (only petroleum jelly is used on axle splines and seals).|~~|~~|~~|The other part is that the axle splines must have not fully seated - and now fully seated after a jerk as the CVT unit actually does measure the "brake" from the overrun which causes jerking if the splines are loose.|~~|~~|~~|It also maybe that someone who was redoing the CVT startup calibration was not following procedure or the tool was not able to write to the car properly and it eventually relearned.

The second friction plate was nearly shot, and filter was clogged up aswell.

This happens only when the car goes above 130, below that speed I have tested and it's fine. I went to the multiple mechanics and no one is able to find the fault. I have changed the transmission fluid even though it wasnt due, opened all shocks, changed the brake pads, cleaned the catalytic, cleaned the fuel pump, serviced the batteries. Almost everything that could be possible I have done but that sound isn't going anywhere, even though it's just for a second or two but it's still there.

textdata: Can you suggest what can those be, because 80 series came with ALL TIME 4WD which is the worst thing when I dont want 4wd and extra wear and tear on my front axles, to my knowledge and research all 80 came with full time 4wd there wasnt even one part time 4wd or rwd tranny. Dont take this as a rant I am simply asking for suggestion that if I dont have knowledge off can you tell me what tranny comes with 80 series so I can find it and put it, otherwise I am torn between r154 and the vigo transmission.

textdata: R154 will break from the loaded up torque - because the chassis is quite heavy and the tires are very large, you will also trash your rear diff too in the process.|~~|~~|~~|To do this get something like a tundra rear diff and a GMTH400 autobox built with a transmission brake so you launch the truck.

As you don't want to do 4x4 so for spins and donuts, it will do it.|~~|~~|~~|But drop the jeep a little low, not very high because, the more lifted it is, the roll angle will be greater plus you will have to use H/t tires not m/t or a/t because they can make the jeep flip.

textdata: Chinese tyres are almost as good as Japanese and half in price. Why not make this saving and spend some amount out of it as sadaqah. Budget japanese tyres like Falken are also very good. In our family we have tried Falken in two Corollas and Chinese in one Corolla. Their drive is smooth safe and qiet. A big no for expensive tyres. Likewise avoid Eurostars and BG Luxo as well. Have used Eurostars in Corollas. They had frequent punctures and were noisy. The BG Luxo in CIvic Turbo also felt noisy and hard. The only plus point of General tyres is their time tested reliability on rough roads. The Elantra may have better noise insulation and soft suspension wherein they are doing as good as expensive Japaese ones.|~~|~~|~~|Point is that we should not fret much on tyres. They are not that complex part of the vehicle.We must not go for the BMWs and Mercedeses of the tyres rather settle for the Toyotas, Suzukis,Hondas and MGs from amogst the tyre brands.|~~|~~|~~|Regards

textdata: Btw dont get it gas torch welded. Identify how much of it is structural and cut up the the rust. Treat the insides properly, i.e. wirewheel, sand down, primer and repaint. Rust convertor is good for only neutralizing surface rust. I have tried multiple brands, it does not provide further protection. Best is to spray rust convertor, let it sit for 10 mins, soak a rag with brake cleaner and clean it off. You will notice how black it comes off, thats the reacted rust. Find a person who can mig/tig weld structure patches and then treat them immediately aswell. Rest you can slap some non structural patches with polyurethane sealant aswell (if you are well versed with it). Make sure that no patch is layered upon old rotten metal and butt welds are done for the patches.

textdata: The main reason behind this rust is the side skirt... Water, mud, and whatnot traps inside. The Panel needs replacement. The panel or you call it side rail, denters call it footrest, whatever you call it available as a whole at the plaza. Have it replaced, treated for rust, and painted. If you want to have the side skirt reinstalled, have some cavity applied to it... it will give significant rust protection if you are near Gulshan or lucky one. Opposite lucky is Khalil Motors, The denter's name is shahid. and he is skillful enough for this job.

Then antirust compound with the help of compound gun would bring a nice smoother finish and rust won't come back so soon unless the car footboard gets bumped from underneath.
